1. Design an algorithm to fi gure out if someone has won in a
game of tic-tac-toe.

2. Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each
pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the
image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

3. You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where
each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in
reverse order, such that the 1’s digit is at the head of the list.
Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the
sum as a linked list.
 Input: (3 - 1 - 5) 1 (5 - 9 - 2)
 Output: 8 - 0 - 8

4. You are given an array of integers (both positive and negative). Find the continuous sequence with the largest sum.
Return only the sum.
 Input: {2, -8, 3, -2, 4, -10}
 Output: 5. (i.e., {3, 2, 4}).

5. Implement a MyQueue class, which implements a queue
using two stacks.

 6. Write an algorithm to fi nd the “next” node (i.e., in-order
successor) of a given node in a binary search tree where
each node has a link to its parent.

 7. Design the OOD for a deck of cards. Explain how you
would implement a Shuffl e() method.

 8. Describe an algorithm to fi nd the largest one million numbers in one billion numbers. Assume that the computer
memory can hold all one billion numbers.

 9. Given two words of equal length that are in a dictionary,
write a method to transform one word into another word
by changing only one letter at a time. The new word you
get in each step must be in the dictionary.
 Input: DAMP, LIKE
 Output: DAMP - LAMP - LIME - LIKE

 10. Given an NxN matrix of positive and negative integers, write
code to fi nd the submatrix with the largest possible sum.
