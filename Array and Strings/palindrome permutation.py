'''
Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
 
Input: Tact Coa 
Output: True (permutations: "taco cat'; "atco etaÂ·; etc.) 

def palindrome -
TC: O(N)
SC: O(N)
